# Rough Draft

I have always been fascinated by the word ‘queue’. In both ways - good, as well as bad. It probably depends on my mood that day. Nonetheless, ‘queue’ never fails to amaze me. 

I mean, how can a word, which pronunciation consists of one letter in total, have 4 more extra letters? Who created this gem? Who felt this maximalist need to ad two more letters to the spelling, and furthermore, double those two letters.

No matter how hard I try, no matter the amount of restless thoughts coursing through my brain, I cannot seem to be able to solve this mystery. 

So ‘queue’ just simply bugs me every time I remember this word exists. And also, provides me with a great subject to base the topic of my essay on.

English spelling and pronunciation can be quite tricky sometimes. However, over the past years, as a non-native speaker, I have noticed a few peculiar examples of English grammar which to me seem very much inexplicable. 

For example the word ‘Wednesday’. Who felt the unrelenting need to add a D and an extra E to the formula? Why is there a B in the word ‘dumb’ and who needs the first R in ‘February’? Coming from a slavic language background, where everything is pronounced as it is written, English grammar is oftentimes a bit hard for me to comprehend. 

Yet there is one word in particular, which amazes me every single time I come across it - the one and only ‘queue’. Something that could have been so simple and sweet, until somebody decided to add four additional letters to the mix. Sure, ‘ueue’ might sound fun on its own, but what exactly is its importance in this case? 

How can even a word like ‘queue’ exist in today’s society? In a society which, on a daily basis, faces challenges such as the constantly accelerating growth of the human population or exhaustion of material resources, and as a result focuses on reduction and minimalism. How is it possible that a word like ‘queue’ exists in this very moment? Who allowed it to take up so much space. All for nothing! Because out of all the five letters, only one is pronounced out loud. In spoken language, the other four letters remain silent. 

Therefore, my question is - what is their function? Do they only exist to waste space in written documents or to lower the chances of guessing the correct word when playing hangman? What is their true meaning?

I might never be able to solve this mystery, I might never find out why do silent letters exist, but I know one thing for sure, and that is - silent letters will always annoy the living hell out of me and the so far unrevealed reasoning behind the spelling of the word ‘queue’ will haunt me in my mind for the rest of my life.

In my mother tongue, our pronunciation is parallel to our spelling. Due to this reason, English grammar is oftentimes a bit hard for me to comprehend.

English spelling and pronunciation can be quite tricky sometimes. I was born and raised in Slovakia, Slovak language is my mother tongue and my brain is probably wired a bit differently compared to a English native speaker’s brain. Over the years, I have noticed a few peculiar examples of English grammar, which I genuinely find very much inexplicable. 

For example the word ‘Wednesday’. Who felt the unrelenting need to add a D and an extra E to the formula? Why is there a B in the word ‘dumb’ and who needs the first R in ‘February’? In Slovak language, a word’s pronunciation is parallel to its spelling. Due to this reason, English grammar is oftentimes a bit hard for me to comprehend.

How can even a word like ‘queue’ exist in today’s society? In a society, where we face challenges such as the growth of the human population or exhaustion of material resources and base our lifestyles on the pillars of reduction and minimalism. How is it possible that a word like ‘queue’ exists in this very moment? Who allowed it to take up so much space. All for nothing! Because out of all the five letters, only ones audible. In spoken language, the other four letters remain silent.
