## Rough Draft

English spelling and pronunciation can be quite tricky sometimes. However, over the past years, as a non-native speaker, I have noticed a few peculiar examples of English grammar which to me seem very much inexplicable. 

For example the word ‘Wednesday’. Who felt the unrelenting need to add a D and an extra E to the formula? Why is there a B in the word ‘dumb’ and who needs the first R in ‘February’? Coming from a slavic language background, where everything is pronounced as it is written, English grammar is oftentimes a bit hard for me to comprehend. 

Yet there is one word in particular, which amazes me every single time I come across it - the one and only ‘queue’. Something that could have been so simple and sweet, until somebody decided to add four additional letters to the mix. Sure, ‘ueue’ might sound fun on its own, but what exactly is its importance in this case? 

How can even a word like ‘queue’ exist in today’s society? In a society which, on a daily basis, faces challenges such as the constantly accelerating growth of the human population or exhaustion of material resources, and as a result focuses on reduction and minimalism. How is it possible that a word like ‘queue’ exists in this very moment? Who allowed it to take up so much space. All for nothing! Because out of all the five letters, only one is pronounced out loud. In spoken language, the other four letters remain silent. 

Therefore, my question is - what is their function? Do they only exist to waste space in written documents or to lower the chances of guessing the correct word when playing hangman? What is their true meaning?

I might never be able to solve this mystery, I might never find out why do silent letters exist, but I know one thing for sure, and that is - silent letters will always annoy the living hell out of me and the so far unrevealed reasoning behind the spelling of the word ‘queue’ will haunt me in my mind for the rest of my life.
