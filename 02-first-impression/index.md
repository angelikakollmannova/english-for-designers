# About

![myself](img/girl-looking-camera.png)

***Hi!***
***I am Angelika - an artist from Slovakia. But who am I beyond that? Honestly, I donâ€™t know. Not because I donâ€™t have any hobbies or passions, but because thereâ€™s so many of them. I am way too many things to pick just one and completely define myself by it.***

I am a graphic designer, but also a singer, songwriter, lyricist and a creative enthusiast in general. I am a student and an intern, but also my own employee relentlessly working on my biggest dreams. I believe, I was given a voice - vocal, visual, as well as verbal, and my main job in this life is to use it. I love expressing myself, my ideas and visions, especially through art, because it gives me unlimited freedom and acceptance. I love to connect with people through my art and offer them something to make their lives a bit more bearable. A bit less painful and lonely. So I guess I could say, I like being bold, loud and out there.

But I also love silence. I may not seem like Iâ€™m the best at it, but I love to just sit and listen. Observe and then analyze. Dig deep into the deepest depths of a matter. Contemplate on the most entangled thoughts thatâ€™ve ever crossed my mind. I am fascinated by everything that transcends us. Psychology, astrology, numerology, all the spiritual beliefs and theories. I love to pick it all apart in my own little 3D reality. 

So who am I beyond a Slovak artist? I guess you could say â€˜a walking contrastâ€™ðŸŒ—

## United Islands of Prague

![united](img/united_islands.png)

United Islands of Prague is a music festival which takes place on Prague's river islands every spring. The festival's ideology is based on values such as diversity, freedom and inclusion. Therefore, when designing its visual identity in December 2022, I opted for fluid, dynamic and organic shapes and bright colors. The logo itself is, however, very simple and clean, only based on a black and white typography, representing fusion between the structuredness of the city and the colorfulness and individality of its inhabitants.

## My Fatherland

I love merging graphic design with music, and this passion of mine gave birth to a purely graphic print I designed for a Czech shop BohÃ©ma in the spring of 2022. It is a poster inspired by the set of six symphonic compositions by BedÅ™ich Smetana called My Fatherland (MÃ¡ Vlast). Each of these compositions is symbolically and also numerically represented in the design. The poster also contains a Spotify scan code, hidden in a blue circle at the top of the poster.

## [ALYA - MESTO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lm1JRj3MLOo)

As I already mentioned, another one (and probably the biggest one) of my passions is music. I have sung and written songs and lyrics ever since I can remember, and I feel very blessed and grateful to do so. It is the best tool for self-expression and healing that I have at my disposal. Since February 2023, I started releasing my music publicly below the music and production label ILLUMINATE and it so far, it has been an absolute dream come true. MESTO (The City) was the third song I've released with my first ever featuring by a Slovak rapper. The song's lyrics is about having that special someone by your side even when the lights turn off and the city quiets down. The music video is based on atmospheric and abstract shots which support the song's mood and idea, rather than following a specific storyline.
