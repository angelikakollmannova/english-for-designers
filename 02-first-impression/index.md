# About

![myself](img/girl-looking-camera.png)

***Hi!***
***I am Angelika - an artist from Slovakia. But who am I beyond that? Honestly, I donâ€™t know. Not because I donâ€™t have any hobbies or passions, but because thereâ€™s so many of them. I am way too many things to pick just one and completely define myself by it.***

I am a graphic designer, but also a singer, songwriter, lyricist and a creative enthusiast in general. I am a student and an intern, but also my own employee relentlessly working on my biggest dreams. I believe, I was given a voice - vocal, visual, as well as verbal, and my main job in this life is to use it. I love expressing myself, my ideas and visions, especially through art, because it gives me unlimited freedom and acceptance. I love to connect with people through my art and offer them something to make their lives a bit more bearable. A bit less painful and lonely. So I guess I could say, I like being bold, loud and out there.

But I also love silence. I may not seem like Iâ€™m the best at it, but I love to just sit and listen. Observe and then analyze. Dig deep into the deepest depths of a matter. Contemplate on the most entangled thoughts thatâ€™ve ever crossed my mind. I am fascinated by everything that transcends us. Psychology, astrology, numerology, all the spiritual beliefs and theories. I love to pick it all apart in my own little 3D reality. 

So who am I beyond a Slovak artist? I guess you could say â€˜a walking contrastâ€™ðŸŒ—
