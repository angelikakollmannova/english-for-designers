# Voice, Tone, and Style


## Voice

### 1. Open
I’m not the biggest fan of small talks. I’d rather be an open book and overshare, than to stick to the boring “the weather is nice today”.

### 2. Authentic
I love to talk. And sometimes it gets messy, sometimes I might sound too academic, and sometimes I let a little swear word slip just to balance things out. But that is exactly who I am and I want my language to be a reflection my true personality.

### 3. Considerate & Respectful
I try to avoid disrespectful and hurtful language, and replace it with kindness and empathy.

## Tone

### 1. Bubbly
You can very easily notice that I laugh and smile a lot. It comes to me so naturally, that I almost can’t imagine speaking without smiling at least a little bit.

### 2. Encouraging
In my opinion, helping and putting smiles on the faces of others is one of the best feelings in the world. Words hold a huge power to do that and I love to use them for this purpose.

### 3. Sometimes Too Formal
I hold my scholar-like vocabulary very dearly, and even if I, therefore, sound too formal and serious at times, I will never give it up.

## Style

### 1. Grammatically Correct
I always had a thing for grammar and writing grammatically correct letters and formal e-mails brings me a lot of joy.

### 2. Friendly
Even if I love grammar and my scholar vocabulary, I still like to sound human and approachable.

### 3. Super-long Sentences
As a result of being a very passionate speaker, sometimes it seems impossible for me to end a sentence, because I feel that I still have some much to say and add to the topic before I cut it off with a full stop, so I just keep on going and going until I have no clue what I was talking about in the beginning of the sentence.
