Hello,
my name is Angelika. 

Today, I’d like to tell you a little story about how I came back to myself. Back to doing what I love and back to living my biggest dream. Despite everything life threw at me, despite all the obstacles, and against all odds. And maybe, if this little TedTalk of mine reaches anyone who’s feeling a bit lost right now, maybe my story might help you or at least encourage you.

I’ve always dreamed of being a singer. I’ve dreamed of writing, recording, releasing and performing my own music and creating something that would touch and connect other people’s souls. 

As a kid, I’ve dreamed of being a Slovak, brunette version of Hannah Montana. 
As a teenager I’ve dreamed of being anybody else but me. 
And today, when I’m finally doing what I’ve always dreamed of, I would love to be my own, re-discovered authentic self.

### Family

I was blessed enough to be born into a family of musicians. Both my parents have done music separately, throughout their whole lives, until they met in a band. After they met, they began performing as a duo all over Europe. They got married, moved into their newly built house, had my older brother and then, almost 23 years ago, it was my turn to enter this world. 

I guess you could say that I was born into a picture perfect, happy and loving, musical family. It must’ve come as no surprise that since my first days here, on this Earth, I sang. Well, screamed, to be more accurate. As a child I loved to sing. I took every opportunity I could, to sing out loud, from the top of my lungs, while my dad played the piano. Or to sing in front of an audience that listened to me and most importantly applauded me. I was making up my own little songs from incomprehensible words and random sounds ever since I can remember. 

I started playing the piano at the age of 5 and as soon as I started going to school, I went to all the singing and piano lessons that I could. And my parents were in full support of these activities.
And I was a very loud, opinionated and extroverted child. And I was totally okay with it. I liked being that way. And I didn’t feel like there was something wrong with me.

Everything seemed perfectly lined up for me, to become who I wanted to be since day one. Everything, except what life had in store for me. 

### Elementary School

In my first year of elementary school, for the first time in my life, I was told and repeatedly emphasized, that I am too much. That I speak too much, I ask too many questions, I make the class laugh too much, I think about "stupid things" too often, that I'm simply too noisy and… I’m too much. And that I should be like other kids and should not disturb. 

It was then, that I felt for the first time that the way I am - loud, talkative, entertaining, curious - I am not acceptable. And from that moment on, I believed that there is something wrong with me. And I tried so hard to be different then who I initially was. I tried to be less. 

I tried so hard not to be too much until one day I woke up feeling like I wasn't enough anymore. Like I wasn’t smart enough, pretty enough, interesting enough, ambitious enough, definitely not talented enough. Just, not good enough. For no one and for nothing.

### High School

But the real turning point happened when I went to high school. I went to a quite prestigious, science and business oriented school. Art in general was not really welcomed there. At that time, my mental health got worse. I had to face strong feelings of anxiety, irrational fear and stress, body dysmorphia, an eating disorder and other self-destructive thoughts and behaviors. I had issues with sleeping, eating, socializing or speaking up and at some point, I even lost my voice for several months. I did a complete 180. 

Under the pressure of potentially not living up to the expectations of others, I almost fully gave up on my musical dream. But it was me who I gave up on completely. My confidence and self-esteem were so low, that even though I knew that I needed help, I didn’t feel worthy of seeking it. And coming from a loving and supporting family and good living conditions, I felt like I had no right to complain. So I remained silent.

I even tried fooling myself into thinking, that music really isn’t my dream. Instead, I tried to make myself believe, that I actually want to pursue a psychological, political, legal or even medical career, when all my heart and soul really wanted to do was music. 

But nothing lasts forever, and so my high school years ended. Thank God! In the middle of a global pandemic though. I was theoretically free from all this academic pressure, but practically not at all. Now, my own future was in my hands and in my hands only. But I had no idea, how to not only handle my future steps, but most importantly - how to handle myself. How to handle my thoughts, my feelings, my unhealthy behaviors and coping mechanisms which I acquired along the way. I had no idea what to do. I was completely lost.

### SuperStar

I guess we all heard of the phrase “once you step out of your comfort zone, that’s when all the miracles start to happen”. So in the middle of a search for a new career path, I signed myself up for the biggest, broadcasted singing competition in Slovakia and Czech Republic, because deep down, during this whole time, I’ve always known what I truly want to do. But I was too scared to do it.

But this time around, I was dedicated to make it work. I was dedicated to give my biggest dream another shot. I picked up all the remains of my courage and confidence and I competed in what turned out to be one of the hardest, most painful and heartbreaking experiences of my life. 

Spoiler alert! I didn’t win. I didn’t even succeed as I expected. However, this competition shed a beaming light on so many underlying issues and problems, which I’ve carried within me my whole life, that I completely broke down. I wasn’t ready to see and face them all. Not without a helping hand.

I was 20 and I officially gave up on music. I thought to myself: “why should I be enough for anything or anybody, when I wasn’t even enough for the judges?”. I completely stopped doing music. I haven’t touched the piano nor have I sang for 8 months. I went to study graphic design instead.

### Illuminate

Yet somehow, a friend I met in this competition, persuaded me in June 2022, to send a recording of me singing to a Slovak music label and production. I sent it, but just because I didn’t want to disappoint her. I had zero expectations. I was prepared to receive the bad news, because I didn’t believe that it was possible for me to succeed in music anymore. But miraculously, it worked out!

All of a sudden, I was a part of a group of young and ambitious people, who already had some amazing achievements on their record. At first, it was hard for me to trust them. To trust that they really believe in me. Because for me, there was nothing to believe in. To me, it made no sense. Why would anyone be on my side, when I have been my biggest hater most of my life. But after some time, I realized, that even if the whole world believed in me, if I don’t believe in me myself, I will never be able to make music professionally.

### My therapy journey

And so the long-awaited day came and I sought help. I went to therapy. And was I surprised at first, when I learnt how much inner work is in-front of me. But I was determined. The love and passion for singing, creating and expressing myself through art was stronger than all my fears, traumas and wounds.
I was determined to find my voice again. To find my authentic self again, because I had no clue who Angelika, a 21 years old singer, was. 

I underwent a variety of different therapeutical approaches. Psychological, regressive, energetic, life coaching and more. I began to heal my relationship with my family members, my friends, those who broke my heart - I mean, honestly, f*ck them, but they taught me a lot - with food, with art, with my inner child, but most importantly - I began to heal the relationship with myself. 

I realized that unless I get to know myself, unless I get to know my heart and soul’s biggest desires, unless I learn how to navigate a healthy inner monologue with myself, unless I learn how to feel empathy and love for myself, and unless I learn how to support myself from within, I’ll never move forward. 

The meaning of the name Angelika is allegedly “messenger of God”. Today, I believe there are many messages for others, as well as for me, that I carry in my heart and mind. This gave me motivation to try my best at therapy. It gave me a higher meaning for all the hard work, that I am currently doing.

Because yes, I am still doing it all for the little girl singing her soul out with her dad by the piano. But I am also doing it for all those who feel lost, broken, lonely, hopeless, misunderstood, afraid. For all those, who don’t feel good enough. I’m doing it for all those, whose biggest obstacle in fulfilling their dream, is their own mind. I’m doing it for all those, who don’t believe in themselves, who don’t love themselves and who are afraid to be their authentic self.

Because I am trying to. And even if it gets hard and overwhelming at times, so far, it has been so worth it. Today, I am more committed than ever to live my life and my biggest dream to its full potential. Because despite all the fear, all the trauma, all the pain, all the feelings of unworthiness and doubt, it is worth it. And you and your dreams are worth it too. Against all odds.
