# My Process

### 1. Choosing the topic

When deciding, what to tell a story about that will be both personal and professional, and is also something I am passionate about, I immediately knew. My music journey. Because I’m trying to turn music into my main profession, but it is also a topic that is very personal and vulnerable for me.

### 2. Timeline

I began with writing down a timeline from my birth until now. I marked down all the important moments and milestones, which affected my journey. Then to each of them, I wrote down what was their effect and how they changed me in the long run. 

### 3. Creating the story

After this, I started connecting them together and creating a story that will have an introduction, main, easy-to-follow plot line and lastly, an ending with an encouraging message.

### 4. Case study 

To be honest, the case study for this story was my life. All my experiences, all the events that had molded me into who I am today and everything I’ve learned in therapy. 

### 5. Creating the story

The last step was highlighting some key words or interesting quotes and using them for the slides of my presentation.
