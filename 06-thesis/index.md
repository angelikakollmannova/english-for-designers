### Introduction

Hi, I’m Angelika! And as some of you already know - maybe because I forced you to listen to my songs and watch my music videos during class - I do music. And I love it. So it must come as no surprise, that for the topic of my bachelor thesis, I combined what I study, which is graphic design, with what I’d love to do in the future as my main profession, and that is music.

### My topic

The topic of my bachelor thesis is The Visual Style of the Music Artist Alya. I am Alya and in today’s world of everything digital, it is a huge plus to have your own, distinctive visual identity. It not only comes in handy when designing visuals for your merchandising or performance, but it ties your whole public persona together and makes it easier for people to remember, recognize and connect with you.

### Process

But it wasn’t so obvious from the beginning. At first I planned on doing a re-design of a festival in Slovakia, then I changed the topic to re-designing the visual identity for an esoteric shop, but then, dear Mr Tvrdoň convinced me to work on something that I actually care about and what is “ze srdíčka”, which translates to “what is close to my heart”.

And so I officially changed my topic for the third time, thinking I chose the best and the smoothest way for my thesis. Not that I regret my decision, because in the end I am glad that that I’m working on something that is both important and useful to me, but I definitely chose the hardest and the bumpiest way possible. Which is also the reason why postponed the submission of my thesis to June.

Only now I’m realizing how hard it is to be your own client, as well as designer. Because I’m quite indecisive. And understandably, I want my thesis to be my best work yet, but I often doubt my choices. And also, it takes a village to create a visual identity for a music artist. I need to come up with a complete branding and marketing product. For that I need the help of a professional stylist and fashion designer, make up and hair artist and a photographer. And just like that my bachelor thesis depends on me and 3 more people, who all have their own schedules and agendas.
But this so far pretty challenging thesis was my idea and despite many personal and health setbacks, I’m not planning on giving up.

### Theoretical part

In my theoretical part I’m writing about important topics crucial for understanding this project. Crucial for understanding why, when I’m “just a graphic designer”, will the practical part of my thesis include photos, specific make up looks and stylings, colors, symbols and more. I’ll try my best to explain, why each of the elements I’m using plays an irreplaceable role in designing a visual style of an artist. 

### Key visuals

Since my actual visuals are still a work in progress, there’s not much I can tell you about them. But what I can say for sure is that my key color will be purple. I thought a lot about which color would suit my music and my personality the best and which color I resonate with the most, until I came across the color “blurple”. It’s a kind of bluish violet. From a spiritual perspective violet is considered the highest vibration in the visible spectrum. Violet also represents the future, imagination, and dreams. It's a creative color, symbolic of counterculture and artistic daring. I will, therefore, be using three shades of this color to be able to represent all of my moods, emotions and thoughts, and all of the music styles that I express myself through when I create.

Another thing that I can reveal about my visuals is my symbol. It will be an asymmetric flower, resembling the flower daisy. Daisies are my favorite kind of flower and they have accompanied me throughout my whole life. The first song I have ever written was called Daisy, I have my mom’s doodles of daisies tattooed on my wrist and I wear a daisy necklace which my dad got me. Also, one of my favorite artists is Takashi Murakami, who is famous for his daisy-looking flowers, so I decided to adopt this symbol quite easily. 

### Copywriting

To me, my copywriting are my lyrics, since I write all of them myself. Through them I get to express everything that I think and feel, even if it’s something, that would be hard for me communicate in a regular conversation. 

That’s why one of my main goals is to encourage people to speak up. Verbally, artistically, physically - the form actually doesn’t matter that much as long as they express themselves. I believe it is incredibly important and it has the amazing power to heal and to prevent unfortunate events. 

### Conclusion

I still have a lot of work in front of me, so please, wish me luck, but I hope that once I’ll finished, I’ll  happy and satisfied that after everything I stuck with this topic. That I stuck with myself.
