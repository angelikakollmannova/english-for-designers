# Year in Review


Honestly, if I look back to April 2023 or even to the beginning of our academic year in October 2023, I went through a lot. These past months were probably one of the hardest, most challenging and intense, yet on the other hand the most educational and transformative months of my life. Career wise, health wise, relationships wise.

## School & Career

I don’t know why, but I always tended to separate my studies from my music. In school, I even hid it from the others at times. But this year and especially our classes have thought me, that I shouldn’t hide who I am and what I love. And that I should be proud of how far I’ve come despite all the obstacles. Against all odds.

Another thing I’ve learned is that my time management needs some improvements. Because if I really want to get the best of both worlds and live my Hannah Montana lifestyle, it can’t be Hannah Montana freestyle. So my goal, which I’m working on currently, is getting a bit more organized and plan things a bit more ahead.

## Health

Just one word. Patience. Probably one of my biggest life lessons. I want everything immediately, including healing. I want to heal my freshly lasered eyes within 3 to 5 business days. I’d like to heal my broken heart in a week. I’d like to get back on track after a couple hikes and yoga sessions, after abandoning myself for months. This year I’ve learned that “to lose patience is to lose the battle” is not just an empty phrase.


## Relationships

All men are liars! I’m just kidding, but am I? This year maybe wasn’t the best time for resolving my trust issues, but it definitely helped me to regain trust in myself again. Because all this time, I knew that I was loving someone who’d eventually break me. I knew it, but I didn’t listen to my gut feeling because I had no self-confidence. I didn’t fully trust myself in anything that I was doing. Instead, I trusted someone who never deserved it in the first place. But I am a huge believer in everything happening for a reason, and although it was quite a painful and heartbreaking experience, it turned out to be one of my most important and valuable lessons.
